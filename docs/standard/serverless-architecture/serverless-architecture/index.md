# Serverless architecture

There are many approaches to using serverless architectures. This chapter explores examples of common architectures that integrate serverless. It also covers concerns that may pose additional challenges or require extra consideration when implementing serverless. Finally, several design examples are provided that illustrate various serverless use cases.

## Serverless architecture examples

Some projects may benefit from taking an "all-in" approach to serverless. Applications that rely heavily on microservices may implement those using serverless technology.
