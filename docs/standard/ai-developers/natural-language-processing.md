# Natural language processing

## Introduction to natural language processing

Common scenarios for NLP: natural language understanding, speech recognition and dialog systems. Explanation for each scenario, and opportunities for each one.

### Conversational applications (bots)

Bot is an app that can interact with users using a conversational interface. Bots are also considered the natural interface for AI applications, and indeed, bots zenith occurs at the same time than the AI peak.

## Use Case: Bot for customer support

Development of a Bot supporting common tasks: answering general user questions (QnA Maker) or tracking current orders (LUIS). Explain use case and reasons behind.

## Bot Framework development

Developers framework for building bots supporting most common clients (Skype, WebChat, Cortana, Facebook Messenger, …), support for Nodejs and .NET languages. Provides a simple base for common business scenarios (customer support – support completing tasks, retail – information of orders, insurance - FAQ, automotive – information of user manuals).

### Design concepts

Main component using Bot framework: channels, bot connector, messages, activities. Main design concepts for using Bot Framework: using Dialogs / FormFlows / Rich cards.

## Cognitive Services, LUIS development

Why use LUIS? It’s a Microsoft Cognitive Service that provides developers with an easy way to create language models to allow applications to understand user commands. Setting up LUIS account and intention rules.
Others cognitive service also worth consideration for using side by side: Text analytics (for sentimental analysis), Bing spell checking, Linguistic analysis (analyse text linguistic structure), QnA Maker (smart FAQ inside conversation).

## Microservice / website development

Adding support for Cognitive Services endpoints. Develop custom web, which support custom flows and visualizations. Azure Bot directory: Deploying & management bot in the cloud.
