# Introduction to AI

## Past, present, and future of AI

In the past, data has been playing a secondary role in business processes. As such, we found data in Descriptive and Diagnostics analysis. But as computing resources and requirements for information gain have increased, the information cross former limits looking for Predictive and Prescriptive analysis. Some historical data about Artificial Intelligence. How is being used in the present? What are the risks

## Basic concepts on AI and Big Data

This section goes over the relationship between AI and Big Data. Big Data is defined under three dimensions (named three Vs):

* Volume: measures the data size.

* Velocity: measures the data change and processing speed.

* Variety: references the different kinds of data structures.

The result of merging three former dimensions would result in the fourth one: Value.

Also, this section describes new paradigms born of the union between AI and Big Data such as conversational interfaces (BOT), streaming processing, IoT, and Cognitive Services.

## Basic concepts on machine learning

In this section, you will learn machine learning basic concepts. But only what you need to know as a developer. Terms to define: structured / unstructured data; what are data feature and data labels; what is a model; classification of machine learning problems (regression, classification, anomaly detection, clustering / recommenders, reinforcement learning); what is a training dataset and how do you evaluate a model (scoring metrics).
