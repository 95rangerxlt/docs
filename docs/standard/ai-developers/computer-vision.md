# Computer vision

## Introduction to Computer Vision

Common scenarios in computer vision problems: Image Classification, Object detection, Image Segmentation, Image Similarity. Explanation for each scenario, and opportunities for each one.

## Use case: image based search

Using a base image, find similar products to the original image. Explain use case and reasons behind.

## Cognitive Services, Vision API development

Custom Vision Service is an easy-to-use tool for prototyping, improving, and deploying a custom image classifier to a cloud service, without any background in computer vision or deep learning required.

## Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning represents the state-of-art in Machine Learning algorithms, and plays a main role in the success of modern Machine Learning solutions. Differences between traditional ML and Deep Learning (no feature engineering and handles easily unstructured data).

## Azure Machine Learning Workbench development

Walkthrough for setting up project and prepping data images for TensorFlow. How to deploy model local / container. 

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source software library for creating computational graphs. Execution is driven by a flow (graph) defined in Python, which is composed by operations at the nodes, and tensors at the edges. Installing and setting up.  Walkthrough implementation code. Prepping data images for being consumed by TensorFlow.

## Microservice / website development

How to consume data coming from TensorFlow deployed either in local or Docker container.
